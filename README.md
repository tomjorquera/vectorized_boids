A small example of a vectorized boid implementation I did for fun.

Based on https://vergenet.net/~conrad/boids/pseudocode.html.

I added a parameter to control the boids perception radius.

Directly animated in the notebook with ipywidgets and matplotlib :smile:

If needed, licence for the code is Apache2.
